22,2018-05-17 00:00:00,no in this pullrequest no change beyond thatfor me the  mean you call something and you usually cant call a moduleim working on refactoring the tracebacks code  without visual change  but once im ready to do visual changes ill do an extensive proposal,0.16953,0.331413,0.448066,0.39101

33,2018-10-25 00:00:00,yes i understand the point i was just doing and dumb listing of the changes from a user point of view and it still lead to the ε character being untypable with the latex equivalent you can still use greek small letter epsilontab but i want to properly document it appologies if it was a confusing comment,0.521695,0.306563,0.338355,0.303935

36,2018-10-13 00:00:00,thats typically a change thats generally considered good though this function is relatively simple and that will make any further backport or history digging around this file more difficult i dont think it is really necessary,0.205779,0.37426,0.465536,0.38198

39,2018-10-16 00:00:00, ipython_warning_is_error to match warningiserrordone syntaxerror is now detected as a error as well i restored the old documentation from 013 that may need some polish,0.446209,0.480044,0.361667,0.2401
40,2019-01-06 00:00:00,thanks that was likely painful to track  i know there was a few left,0.436089,0.201749,0.381834,0.433367
41,2019-01-08 00:00:00,yes on my todo list but tiem is short and dayjob is taking more time than planned after holidays would you mind creating an issue that list the step that are remaining  you can copypast from the 72 one one of the biggest task is writing the whats new,0.506854,0.15581,0.417582,0.336909
42,2018-11-11 00:00:00,sure do you want to send a pr  i guess we can either let the user define a value for both or a format string,0.272003,0.28468,0.428305,0.452723
43,2018-05-24 00:00:00,thanks for reviving that 1 i believe in 37 await at top level is valid should we support that only for 37 and get rid of all the ast munging and complexity of making the parsing work in 36 and below 2 im baffled by the test faillures iptest ipythoncoreteststest_application ipythoncoreteststest_async_helpers fails but each independently succeed,0.115722,0.203433,0.313551,0.418015
44,2018-10-21 00:00:00,i think chris was suggesting refactoring and being clearer with headingsubheading you can see the rendered version therehttpsipythonreadthedocsioenlatestdevelopmentipython_directivehtml there is a lot of duplicate information and organisational issues,0.511683,0.243635,0.427854,0.342804
45,2018-12-06 00:00:00,1 we likely want to remind user they might need to restart the kernel,0.158038,0.2413,0.467089,0.126162
46,2018-11-03 00:00:00,meeseeksdev backport to 5x,0.495123,0.192658,0.244983,0.105934

48,2018-05-18 00:00:00,1 i left inline commenti wold be happy if we could have both sidebyside in master raising a warning error if the result of the transformation is different but that seem easier to use than previous machinery,0.49304,0.239931,0.461913,0.30297
49,2018-05-24 00:00:00,so one possibility is to run the nested instances using different event loop or to drop the support for nested embed for now until all is async and we can run an async embed,0.410449,0.234287,0.437605,0.124942
50,2019-01-06 00:00:00,so maybe we can add a pythonwarningsall python werror m compileall  to travis ci,0.407965,0.156261,0.682367,0.372433
51,2018-06-13 00:00:00,pfff pebkac i was testing without 11174 merged and so was still seing resourcewarnings,0.318982,0.432311,0.077217,0.292643

55,2018-10-21 00:00:00,thanks  ill have to look at that more in depth but it would be good to have a test to not have regressions,0.382127,0.360605,0.192326,0.155841
56,2018-11-29 00:00:00,thats sounds reasonable to me does it has any reason to break user code,0.257532,0.297523,0.521366,0.430935
57,2018-10-27 00:00:00,looks good  thanks,0.561279,0.238131,0.41945,0.105934

60,2018-08-06 00:00:00, he original code in modules_pathpy indicates that we want to ignore bytecode return full path of module or none if module is missing or does not have py or pyw extension we are not interested in running bytecode however there was an existing unit test that explicitly checked that pyc filepaths were returned rather than returning none is it correct to assume that we want to ignore filepaths that lead to pyc files this assumption has been made in this pri believe ignoring pyc is the right thing this appear to be use in deepreload and run which you likely want to run on modified py  files so that seem the right call it also seem to be used _only_ there so at some point we may want to move that somewhere else awesome work that looks good to me so merging and well see if we get complaints,0.390032,0.484855,0.558118,0.464887

75,2018-01-03 00:00:00,seem reasonable to me the test failures looks like jedi is not working strange,0.308246,0.275902,0.235998,0.449779
76,2019-02-18 00:00:00,side question are you familiar with travis ci and how to check if the rest are passing,0.42057,0.424096,0.374827,0.441623
77,2018-04-01 00:00:00,1 as a workaround but we should have a proper fix at some point,0.39356,0.492763,0.339085,0.336904
78,2018-11-05 00:00:00,for all the difference between 6x and 7x see the whats newhttpsipythonreadthedocsioenstablewhatsnewversion7html there is no major compatibility issue if you dont use custom extensions im happy to get the fix in the 6x branch but its likely never going to end up on pypi or conda you can still install source from a specific commit if that helps that is unless there is interest for someone to maintain 6x but the current core dev are doing that on their free time and already plenty to dobut in general yes as an open source project we only support the latest branch in this case 7x and use the latest unless you you really need to stick to an old one if you need support for an old version you can also discuss support with anaconda inc,0.45899,0.68033,0.3727,0.394265
79,2018-10-16 00:00:00, im having problems with squashing all commits into one but my changes are theredo you mind if i do that for you and push on your branch  also sidenote you want to learn how to work on multiple branches if you look at the top of this pr you can see that the request is to merge lucianamarquesmaster into ipythonmaster that prevents you from working on multiple things at the same time usually you want to something along the line of git branch fix11401 git checkout fix11401 work git push and the the pr will ask to merge lucianamarquesfix11401 into ipythonmasterand you can keep working on other branches without worry of fix11401 being modified the workflow here is approximatif you are free to modify it but learning on how to manage multiple branches will be extremely helpfulldo not worry git is not obvious but youll learn your way around it,0.446981,0.234352,0.482596,0.404847
80,2018-05-25 00:00:00,the problem with this is if we have any further downstream ast transformers looking at the first node then this wont work as the first node will be gone in multiline statements,0.15212,0.211816,0.401047,0.498335
81,2018-10-14 00:00:00, what are the next steps now should we do some more testingno more step for this issue that you for this specific issue i dont think more testing is necessary ill just update 11333 so that once we drop 36 the code can actually be removed but that will take a couple of years good job,0.510877,0.307505,0.388768,0.101933
82,2018-10-01 00:00:00,that seem incorrect now a  1 is considered as incomplete while its not,0.488031,0.223594,0.190278,0.297672

101,2019-02-20 00:00:00, so sorry for the delayno need to apologise you are not officially working on the project and you contributed  a lot already   im happy with the changes but i would be much happier if we shared authorship as previously discussed i have two commits in the branch now so ill have partial credit il like for you to look at a few things were planning participating in outreachy again  you expressed interest in being in an internship and i would love if we can do that woudl you mind reading participating in the following discussion  httpsdiscoursejupyterorgtthinkingaboutreapplyingtooutreachyinmay20194042  it would be great for you to write a small summary of what this pr achieves create a file with a few line in docssourcewhatsnewpr  it will be used to tell user about the new feature again work on what you like,0.414717,0.339954,0.384299,0.361061

108,2018-09-07 00:00:00,ok seem like weve reached quasi static state and most of the latest updates were documentation plus ipykernel works with that so im going to merge thanks all involved  and we can refine if necessary,0.437942,0.2341,0.424286,0.221943
109,2018-09-09 00:00:00,i also havent been involved before so it would take time to be uptospeed iirc about warnings we do clear the warning registry explicitly so warning reappearing and custom logic being needed make sens to me,0.384784,0.346133,0.195866,0.322264

119,2018-08-14 00:00:00,im thinking of dropping 34 as maintaining compat with it will be painful there are no specific plans for the next release of python 34 however the expectation is that python 3410 will be released in march of 2019 and this will be the final release of python 34well also be supporting 35 36 and 37minrk  and takluyver thoughts,0.20467,0.248097,0.398173,0.364193
120,2018-10-09 00:00:00,running test is a bit weird as we are a python shell you need to not be in ipython directory and run iptestto run a single test i would for example run  cd  iptest ipythoncoreteststest_inputtransformer2test_check_complete cd you can also just push on the branch and let travis ci work for you,0.513173,0.172707,0.159704,0.391585

126,2018-05-17 00:00:00, this all looks fine though i dont know why wed want to plan a refactor afaik pycolorize has been deprecated for some time in favour of pygmentsright now its in use in ultratb and i want to refactor ultratb to separate generating the tb information from formattingill progressively change ultratb to yield list of tokens that will still be formatted by pycolorize i can make pycolorize aware of out own tokens typeand once ultratb is cleaner i can move away from pycolorize and use pygments pretty trivially also then i can format tracebacks with something else than ansi like html or a proper mimebundle rendered by the frontenddoes that make some sens,0.344836,0.146663,0.348089,0.126162

143,2018-10-13 00:00:00,in general we try to avoid cleaning up for the sake of cleaning up it has many disadvantages   it often prevent from backporting patches as now there are conflicts   it screw up git blame and git bisect to find the root cause of a bug or the reason for change   it often may look like the same code but there may be some subtle behavior changes that are hard to track down especially since that both do some purely stylistic change and some code refactor im a bit worried there is also some stylistic changes that are both incoherent with the rest of the codebase and against pep8 but we only partially follow thatill try to review the code inline,0.479131,0.184793,0.426301,0.271255

148,2018-10-21 00:00:00,ok that make sens so one question would it make sens to move that inside make_tokens_by_line so that make_tokens_by_line  return consistent value regardless of the version of python  that feels cleaner to me  thoughts,0.349348,0.489837,0.317428,0.380313
149,2018-05-24 00:00:00,ive pushed a tiny fix to the loop_runner to ensure it is a callable and that if curiotrio or asyncio string were passed they were mapped to the correct runner and not to the module themselves after importswith this running ipython under trio does seem to work with the asyncio loop not running not sure what that does in a notebook though img width652 altscreen shot 20180524 at 14 21 53 srchttpsuserimagesgithubusercontentcom33556740514399d8fb4ba25f5d11e889b7e5b42aa86f7epng,0.479421,0.265435,0.260961,0.484514

219,2019-03-19 00:00:00,would you mind having a look at this new version  i proposed an alternative with less recursion which appear to work on my machine test and docs are still needed though and code need to be cleaned up,0.540285,0.590035,0.327375,0.318361

231,2018-10-25 00:00:00, the problem was happening due to merge conflicts was this nothing to do with python version or anything elseyes and no there was still som conflict where merged marked like the following were still there one headdoctestdoctest  other headand we build the documentation only on python 37 so it was failing only on python 37,0.254804,0.162219,0.069186,0.466176
232,2018-11-01 00:00:00,there is something weird happening in the test we probably need to pin the pip version on old version of python,0.442909,0.263583,0.422188,0.400255
233,2018-10-13 00:00:00,that seem more uniform though that will conflict will already existing pr it would be better to do as separate changes ill see which pr is easier to apply first,0.444744,0.209852,0.651434,0.360851

238,2018-09-01 00:00:00,ok i was wrong for above the only way i can see is to use subprocess and run python i and check the output something similar to ipythonterminalteststest_embedpyhttpsgithubcomipythonipythonbloba85a08ccc63726c1a2ee8bde8fa05a3cb2955dd9ipythonterminalteststest_embedpyill see if i can write a scaffold for that,0.516291,0.322001,0.521228,0.337268

242,2018-10-21 00:00:00, yes thank you i missed that it definitely makes sense to move the logic into make_tokens_by_line ive made another commit for thatok great i added a suggestion of comment to remind us when to remove that in a couple of years once this is done im 1,0.451046,0.195238,0.565511,0.279678

244,2018-08-28 00:00:00,takluyver id like to try to cut a 70 current september we had no complaint so im assuming everyone is 1 so i suggest fixing conflict relatively trivial merging and moving onwith that we can get a beta for about a week then rc and final by hopefully mid to late september how does that sound,0.444211,0.18605,0.274703,0.105934
245,2018-10-22 00:00:00,takluyver   good to see you  i would suggest waiting for gh to be back on green httpsstatusgithubcommessagessome messages have been lost and pr unmerged,0.377892,0.178715,0.349221,0.410643
246,2018-05-16 00:00:00,actually i think i should port that to 6x as 70 will not be release for python 37meeseeksdev backport to 6x,0.369489,0.232439,0.400255,0.224775

249,2018-10-08 00:00:00,thanks all lets try to get that in and have an ipython 71 by end of weekthat should match the imminent release of python 371 that have the compatibility issues mentioned earlier,0.33655,0.163905,0.251369,0.286858

251,2018-10-16 00:00:00,you can now set ipython_strict_fail  false in your configpy to get back previous behavior if you have a better name,0.182782,0.523252,0.421594,0.105934
252,2019-02-05 00:00:00, is there a way we can share the author rights of these when theres a commit ready to merge i feel like most of the work was done by you even if im committing themhaha dont worry i have plenty of commits already there apparently is a way to ahve multiple authorshttpshelpgithubcomarticlescreatingacommitwithmultipleauthors but its cumbersome so feel free to take all the glory,0.496903,0.249066,0.326997,0.376433
253,2018-05-17 00:00:00,ive read part of this ill let it settle a bit in my head and come back to it how easy would it be to compare currentnew transformations discarding the old one but comparing and raising a warning if there is a difference,0.379492,0.515841,0.319764,0.429942

263,2019-01-21 00:00:00,that seem reasonable lets try it im just going to postpone a bit merging in case i or you have to motivation to write some tests,0.182782,0.281158,0.527174,0.31012
264,2018-10-13 00:00:00,that looks good to me,0.288113,0.255341,0.252317,0.299807
265,2018-10-13 00:00:00,that seem strait forward here but actually the semantics are different and i even believe some other branches in the code are wrong in particularstyle_overrides  _style_overrides_linux and style_overrides  _style_overrides_light_bgindeed later on we do style_overridesupdateselfhighlighting_style_overrides so if you assign something to style_override instead of using update you will mutate the original _style_overrides_light_bg _style_overrides_linux and with your patch _style_overrides_windows which is surprising so yes to deport them as global variable but we need to be sure of what update vs  assing will do,0.197388,0.25906,0.451249,0.349333
266,2018-10-21 00:00:00,yes feel free to make any replacement you feel is better,0.440313,0.294114,0.375552,0.219618
267,2018-05-24 00:00:00, i dont think this is true unfortunately maybe 38 if someone steps up to do it i suspect the main asyncio maintainers will be too busy to get to itwell ok maybe 38 but in nightly at least astparse now allows async top levelcompile does fail though  minrk obviously tornado is the natural place to start given how ipykernel works but have you thought at all about how to support alternative event loopsthat is also my concern but then i guess we have 2 questions do we allow to run triocurio code by locally blocking for the current cell because when running in ipykernel you obviously cant run using the trio or curio runner to run async_cells or can we,0.341516,0.311545,0.498599,0.392246

269,2018-09-07 00:00:00, i think the long term fix is to get to the point where its always async and we dont need to check so im happy with this as the current stateok lets get that in hopefully at some point well have asyncexec in core python,0.479358,0.137081,0.242119,0.469502

272,2018-08-21 00:00:00,i have to better understand the implication it is likely possible though it will likely work only on terminal ipython it might also not stay forever as in the end i want ipython to always run on an event loop though i guess we could run only on the pseudosync or a nonasyncio one once that hapend we can figure out how to patch run in order to patch run_until_complete,0.414026,0.215758,0.384859,0.336767

282,2018-10-23 00:00:00,i would have to read the code but converting to new version seem the rightmove lets try to change and see if the test are failling on mon oct 22 2018 2244 hai notificationsgithubcom wrote                   remember if the lines ends in a new line         ends_with_newline  false         for character in reversedcell             if character  n                 ends_with_newline  true                 break             elif characterstrip                 break             else                 continue         if ends_with_newline              append an newline for consistent tokenization              see httpsbugspythonorgissue33899             cell  n this is the code at the top of the check_complete i think the last if statement should have been if not end_with_newline if so the fix could be further simplified also currently the logic of the fix is to convert from the recently fixed module in python 371 back to the old form in prior python version it would be more appropriate to change the fix to address the problem in older python version rather than manipulating the now fixed implementation any thoughts  you are receiving this because you commented reply to this email directly view it on github httpsgithubcomipythonipythonpull11425issuecomment432100889 or mute the thread httpsgithubcomnotificationsunsubscribeauthaauez5ya0s0vsgzitvyoq14ckuh62wkoks5unqzvgajpzm4xyiqf,0.119288,0.265435,0.538437,0.337379

286,2018-08-04 00:00:00,thanks if you use pyenv it would be preferable to set up a global gitignorehttpshelpgithubcomarticlesignoringfilescreateaglobalgitignore as using pyenv is a decision you make and not one ipython did still merging this at it will be of help for other but setting up your global gitignore is usually a good idea,0.522679,0.422897,0.398733,0.420139
287,2018-11-08 00:00:00,the error is unrelated to what you did we just added a subclasses field and other part of ipython is not handling that correctly ive added one commit that hopefully should fix thatmany thanks and awesome work  lets wait for the test to pass just to make sure i did not forget anything and then we can merge what you did into master meeseeksdev say congrats cmentzel meeseeksdev party,0.115021,0.265435,0.467391,0.405309

309,2018-05-25 00:00:00,im happy to drop the necessity to have nested ipythons but we should likely ask on the mailing list first for how many users of this feature we havei think the need for embed have two sides 1 running in an existing eventloop  2 blocking an event loop and inspecting current statei dont believe in 2 we need a lot of async integrations so im happy to clearreplace eventloopnjsmith how hard would it be to have a version of triorun that can be reentered  how negatively would you react to us wrapping triorun in the following context manager pythoncontextmanagerdef new_context    import trio_core_run as tcr    old_runner  getattrtcrglobal_run_context runner none    old_task  getattrtcrglobal_run_context task none    if old_runner        del tcrglobal_run_contextrunner    if old_task        del tcrglobal_run_contexttask    yield    if old_runner        tcrglobal_run_contextrunner  old_runner    if old_task        tcrglobal_run_contexttask  old_task,0.409195,0.265435,0.174975,0.276576

313,2018-11-03 00:00:00,the failure  on python 3 is unrelated its just that the new version of pip is incompatible with python 3im happy to get that in but there will likely not be any further release of ipython 6x do you have any specific reason to want to fix 6x,0.188855,0.194708,0.242374,0.409735
314,2018-10-13 00:00:00, keep in mind that this could break the input hooks for ui toolkits which ipython has right now did you test thatno i did not test and this likely also bypass the pre and post execute hooksthis was mostly an experiment to see how much change was needed and think about what internal api to deprecate as we just released 70 i doubt i want to merge this in the 7x branch,0.431029,0.222537,0.53741,0.322411

318,2019-02-18 00:00:00,there is one more issue if we run the test here we can see that if x for x in names if xstartswiths is empty then we should not return s but an empty string this might be a bug somewhere else in ipython but it breaks the test suite i can fix it like so  diff completerpy2076  def fwd_unicode_matchself textstr  tuplestr list          if text starts with slash         if slashpos  1             s  textslashpos1            return s x for x in names if xstartswiths            candidates  x for x in names if xstartswiths            if candidates                return s x for x in names if xstartswiths            else                return            if text does not start with slash         else            return u             return u,0.381446,0.294114,0.36937,0.425089

320,2019-01-24 00:00:00,thanks for the bug report and the pr as you said there may be many places where the clear_frames need to be applied so maybe we should open an issue to track those as we are  still in a minor release cycle im in favor of not changing the behavior and postponing thee change of behavior if any to ipython 8though ive only scanned though the issue and need to get a better deeper lookim in the process of releasing 73 soon which is overdue by a month but im hopping to do minor releases monthly when possible anyway,0.491959,0.563877,0.426707,0.556218

358,2018-11-02 00:00:00, are you blocking the pr due to unrelated issues with the travis ci testingblocking is a strong word id like to get it fix either by someone or me to make sure there is no other regressions  but there is just so much hours in days and i only working on ipython as volunteer so ill get to it when i have time getting this release will also take some time ill see if i can work on that this weekend btw we have a bot to do backport if necessary so usually you can either just as a commiter to mention the bot or we can whitelist people to be able to mention the bot,0.434079,0.396274,0.273472,0.203328

369,2018-09-07 00:00:00,yep seem like a better solution than current yield thingi guess there is likely some extra refactor we can do as we seem to apply the transformers and check for async both in run_cell_async and should_run_async which tend to show there is likely a better abstraction but im happy to move forward with this,0.491274,0.28352,0.390719,0.326875
