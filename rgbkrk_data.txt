2018-12-06T13:59:19Z			love this organization around args needing y or the prefix 
2018-08-16T17:33:52Z			is there a chance that this will never run the script where onload or onreadystatechange are called yet thisreadystate is not complete 
2018-05-02T17:29:08Z			this will target a 56x milestone right 
2018-12-10T23:25:27Z			thanks yall 
2018-08-23T04:35:08Z			_fantastic_ 
2018-04-17T23:24:41Z			this ended up affecting both nbconvert and papermill with python 2x kernels 
2018-12-06T14:33:27Z			this works pretty well the only hidden api surface to this is that this allows the full pip api we likely wouldnt be able to extend this with new args possibly for something ipython  jupyter specific capturing metadata accepting a flag to do soneedless to say im cool with this implementation
